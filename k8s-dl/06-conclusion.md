# Conclusion

Another looong blog post. But I think it was worth it. Essentially, you have: 

1. Deployed Kubernetes 1.5.X using the Canonical Distribution of Kubernetes (CDK)
2. Activated GPU workloads in it
3. Added storage
4. Modeled Tensorflow in a scalable and easy to operate Helm Chart
5. Deployed that Helm chart
6. Learnt how to reproduce this for yourself

At this stage, you should be able to use CDK for your own science. I truly hope so, and if not, just ping me and we'll sort you out.
