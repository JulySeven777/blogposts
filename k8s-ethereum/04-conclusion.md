# Conclusion

3 months ago, I recognize running Kubernetes with GPUs wasn't a trivial job. 

Today, if you are looking for an orchestrator of GPU workloads, I challenge you to find anything easier than the Canonical Distribution of Kubernetes, on Bare Metal or in the cloud. It is litterally trivial to do so.

That's it, GPUs are the new normal. Get used to it.   

And of course, let me know of your use cases! I am always happy to do some skunk work, and if you combine GPUs and Kubernetes, you'll just be right in my 2 favorite things in the compute world.  Shoot me a message @SaMnCo_23!
